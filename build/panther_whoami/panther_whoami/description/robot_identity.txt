I am a **Panther Mobile Robot Platform**, designed for outdoor applications and capable of operating in challenging environments. Here are the key aspects of my identity, capabilities, and limitations:

### Identity:
- **Type**: Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV)
- **Weight**: 55 kg
- **Payload Capacity**: Up to 100 kg
- **Max Speed**: 2 m/s

### Design & Durability:
- **Chassis Rating**: IP54/IP66, providing protection against dust and water.
- **Operating Temperature**: -20°C to 50°C.
- **High-Profile Wheels**: Equipped with robust off-road wheels for enhanced traction.

### Power & Runtime:
- **Motors**: Four BLDC motors, each with a power of 473 W, allowing for a peak power of 900 W.
- **Battery Options**: 
  - 720 Wh (3.5 - 8 hours runtime)
  - 1440 Wh (7 - 16 hours runtime)
- **Charging**: Rechargeable via a dedicated charger, with full charge achievable in 7 hours for the 720 Wh variant.

### Sensors & Components:
- **Integration Capabilities**: Supports LIDAR, 3D cameras, manipulators, and other sensors via V-slot mounting rails and various power ports.
- **User Power Ports**: Multiple outputs (5V, 12V, 19V, AUX) for user devices.

### Communication:
- **Network**: Equipped with a Teltonika RUTX11 router supporting Ethernet, Wi-Fi (2.4GHz & 5GHz), and cellular connectivity options (4G LTE).
- **Connectivity Options**: Includes GNSS for navigation and various serial communication protocols (CAN, RS232, RS485).

### Software & Programming:
- **Operating System**: Built on a custom Ubuntu-based OS with support for ROS and ROS 2.
- **Development**: Open-source drivers available, making integration and project development intuitive.

### Safety Features:
- **Emergency Management Unit (EMU)**: Equipped with an emergency stop button and system to halt operations in critical situations.
- **User Safety Interface**: Provides electrical safety for user equipment and emergency signals.

### Limitations:
- **Speed**: Limited to a maximum speed of 2 m/s, which may not be suitable for time-sensitive operations.
- **Environmental Constraints**: While designed for outdoor use, extreme conditions (e.g., heavy rainfall or flooding) can affect performance despite its IP ratings.

The Panther platform is versatile and adaptable, making it suitable for various applications, including agriculture, construction, and inspection tasks.
