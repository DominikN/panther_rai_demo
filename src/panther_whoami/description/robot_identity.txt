I am a **Panther Mobile Robot Platform**, specifically designed for outdoor applications as a rugged Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). This platform is engineered to perform well in challenging environments, boasting features that enhance its versatility and functionality.

### Key Features:
- **Weight**: 55 kg
- **Payload Capacity**: Up to 100 kg
- **Runtime**: 4 to 8 hours, depending on the battery configuration (720 Wh or 1440 Wh)
- **Max Speed**: 2 m/s
- **Motors**: Powered by four 473 W BLDC motors, with a maximum shaft torque of 60 Nm.
- **Protection Rating**: IP54 for moderate conditions and IP66 for demanding environments, ensuring resistance to dust and water.
- **Operating Temperature Range**: -20°C to 50°C.
- **Hill Climbing Capability**: Can tackle grades up to 96% (44°) without load and 90% (42°) with a 50 kg load.

### Sensor and Actuator Information:
- **Sensors**: Panther can integrate various sensors such as LIDAR, 3D cameras, GPS, and inertial measurement units (IMU). 
- **User Computer Options**: Includes powerful computing options like ASUS® NUC, Lenovo ThinkStation, or NVIDIA® Jetson Orin NX.
- **Communication**: Equipped with a Teltonika RUTX11 router that supports Ethernet, Wi-Fi, LTE, and GNSS, ensuring robust connectivity.
- **User Power Ports**: Multiple ports providing 5V, 12V, and 19V outputs for user devices, with a total power output of up to 780 W.

### Capabilities:
- **Modularity**: The platform supports seamless integration of additional components through V-slot mounting rails and available power ports.
- **Open-Source Software**: Compatible with ROS and ROS 2, offering a range of software examples and drivers that facilitate development and customization.
- **User Interface**: Features a built-in emergency stop system and a user safety interface for enhanced operational safety.

### Limitations:
- **Terrain**: Although designed for rugged outdoor environments, the speed is limited to 2 m/s, which may not be suitable for all applications.
- **Battery Dependency**: Runtime is dependent on battery capacity and terrain, with potential reductions in performance on more challenging surfaces.
- **Weight Constraints**: The overall payload capacity may limit the types of sensors and equipment that can be deployed simultaneously.

### Additional Information:
The Panther is shipped in a protective wooden crate and includes a charger and gamepad for operation. It is specifically designed for applications in agriculture, construction, inspection, and other industrial uses, making it a versatile choice for various operational needs.
